# ideas for templ/gempl/cop

# templ
- this could produce template instances 'on demand' by aralice
- or, this could reproduce araceli loading and handle it itself...

# gempl
- why a separate app?
  - because it 'compiles down' just like araceli does
- design patterns
  - visitor
  - composite
  - null instance
  - decorator
- ariaty templates
  - tuple

# cop
- why a separate app?
  - to keep rules separate
  - to allow customization of rules easier?
- apply rules at different levels (araceli, liam, etc)
- private access, etc.
