Using release mode shtemu to run app images crashes, doing something as simple as printing text to the screen.  I'm unable to understand why.

Necessary ingredients for the crash
- cmn.lib is compiled with -O3
- print service is using cdwINFO() and not printf()
- app is testdata/lats only

What I tried
- examining C++ code generated by gcc and comparing it to handwritten stuff
- adding more locals to make sure stack is aligned in .target.ara
- using __attribute__((noinline)) and/or __attribute__((optimize("O0")))

I might be willing to live with this for now unless more evidence comes to light that it's my fault

What I'm doing now:
- built a shtemu simple test to tweak assembly code
- screwed with oscall.asm until that worked
- verified that lats then worked
  - had to disable splitter
- test is still broken
  - because of splitter...?
    there's decent evidence that this is a stack misalignment problem.  But I'm not sure I'm on the right track...

YES!  It is stack alignment.  The stack must be 16-byte aligned upon entrance into a function, which includes the return address that the call instruction adds.  I was able to prove this by adding dummy padding variables in lats.
